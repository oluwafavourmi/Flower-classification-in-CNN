# Flower-classification-in-CNN

This project uses the concept of Transfer Learning to training a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network Model on how to identify different flowers,
The flowers are:
    1. LILY
    2. ROSE
    3. SUNFLOWERS
The training and testing images were all web-scraped from the internet using a chrome extension called "Fatkum". 
subsequently updates will be made to this respository.
